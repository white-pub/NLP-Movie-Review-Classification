# NLP: Movie Review Classification

This project focuses on classifying IMDB movie reviews into positive or negative categories using Naive Bayes. The steps include:
1. Load the dataset and create a binary target column.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis on text documents.
3. Transform text data into vectors using various methods such as count vectors, binary vectors, TFIDF, Word2Vec, or transformers (ex: BERT and GPT).
4. Train and tune multiple models, performing cross-validation.
5. Explore, preprocess, and vectorize test data.
6. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and confusion matrix.
